# My First Game
This was my introduction to the software world. I used Game Maker Studio to design and code all assets and functionality.

Check the release to download the game and try it out yourself!

**Installation**
1. Go to release tags and find the latest version
2. Download and extract files (ensure it is not in your download folder)
3. Run the executable!
